## Idea for the SILQ Party, the Scientists for Integrates Life Quality political party for a better world.

Me:
We, scientists, unite to develop alternative ideas, of how existing countries and administrations should change their laws and rules specificially to maximize the world population's fully integrated life quality. 
Build upon sensible, interdisciplinary and evidence based research.
Employing both traditional and controlled state-of-the-art ML methodologies.
Of course, we will propose feasible suggestions only.

## Party Program of the Scientists for Integrated Life Quality (SILQ)
Preamble
We, the Scientists for Integrated Life Quality (SILQ), unite researchers, analysts, and thinkers to develop innovative, evidence-based policy solutions. Our mission is to maximize the integrated life quality of the world population by reforming laws and institutions based on rigorous scientific research, traditional data analysis, and cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools. We commit to proposing realistic, actionable policies that are compatible with real-world constraints.
1. Science-Driven Policy Reform
